# :beer: PUNK-API

This project uses the punk api and ReactJs to create an web application that can filter through the beers included within the api. <br>
<br>
To use the application is simple. Either search the name of a product with all filters placed at max values for every product possible or you can use the filters to search for a specific product and you can then also search for the product via name and it will search within the specified filtered ranges.
Sliders are used to find the desired category up to the chosen value.

### :computer: Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- ReactJs

### :pencil: Methods:

To ensure best practice, the api would only filtered through the array once fetched rather than using params to change the url to view different beers individually. <br>
The application also has a sticky side navbar on desktop to allow users to continue to scroll through pages without having to lose any filtering features.

### :heavy_check_mark: Features:

One of the components used within the application is the slider filter.
