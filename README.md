# PUNK-API

This project uses the punk api and React to create an app that can filter through the beers included within the api

## Methods

To ensure best practice, the api would only filtered through the array once fetched rather than using params to change the url to view different beers individually.

Sliders are used to find the desired category up to the chosen value.
